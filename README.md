# DSE512pytorch

This repository is for DSE512, it creates a Parallel Data convolutional neural network to train on the MNIST Dataset.  It is meant to be run on the ISAAC system at UTK and trains for 30 epochs in order to determine the means of this dataset.  A conda environment is assumed that includes torch.

Some notes: 
The datatrain.py file will be used in order to train the model
The visualize.py file will be used in order to visualize the results

Some portion of this will depend on the number of processes used in the dataset.
